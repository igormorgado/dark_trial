Why these colors?
=================

The main idea is to build a dark theme, easy on the eye, for long coding sessions. The color should be pick for highcontrast with pastel shades to avoid eye strain, bleeding and blink.

The background color of choice was a almost dark but not a pure black color, using a very dark shade of gray. For foreground the same idea applies, instead using a pure white color, a darker and more soft gray shade was used.

The first block of colors (1 to 6), has a very high contrast with Black and BrBlack foreground or background. That provides high readibility to long time coding sessions. The second block (9 to 14), has very high contrast with white colors providing cabapilities to different types of accents and "On colors".

Using this pattern the contrast is always over 7:1 keeping full compatibility with WCAG 2.0 standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). 

Even Green, Yellow and Cyan can be used over the Bright color with at least AA18 compatibility. Also BrBlue is fully AA compatible with all low part of pallete colors.
